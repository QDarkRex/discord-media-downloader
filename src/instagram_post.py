"""Download an Instagram post and send its media to a Discord channel.

A post can be a single photo, a single video/reel, or a carousel (many of either).
We upload every item. Videos over Discord's upload cap get an ffmpeg re-encode
(reusing the helpers in discord_post); if a video still won't fit (or compression is
off) we post its source link instead, so nothing is ever silently dropped. Oversized
images (rare) fall back to a link too.

Kept separate from discord_post.py (the TikTok path) on purpose — the TikTok flow is
single-video; Instagram is multi-file — but it imports the shared compress helpers so
there's no duplicated ffmpeg code.
